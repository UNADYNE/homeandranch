Embracing a modern influence to craftsman designs this is one of a handful of homes professionally remodeled.   Glass French doors open into the large formal dining room and a second set of French doors presents the commercial grade kitchen with a Wolf range and Subzero refrigerator. Matte black granite counters contrast white craftsman cabinets complimented with a white subway tile backsplash. The house flows well for gathering including a covered outdoor brick patio just off the kitchen presenting outdoor dining space for summer nights.  The main floor offers two en-suite bedrooms and a guest half bath. The master suite is generously sized. The master opens up to the backyard onto the redwood deck offering indoor-outdoor living. Trees envelope the yard creating a private sanctuary in the shade.   The walk-out lower level is connected via the two car garage. With two bedrooms and 2 bathrooms there is plenty of room for everyone.  With surround sound, wet bar, built-in cabinetry and entertainment center this is the perfect spot for a theater experience. The laundry room, workshop, plenty of storage and a wine cellar wrap up the lower level.  All close to trails, downtown Ogden and only a 25 minute drive to Snowbasin ski resort, Pineview reservoir and minutes to the Ogden River for fishing.",
